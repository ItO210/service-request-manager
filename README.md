# Cicata Nexus: A Laboratory Service Request and Inventory Management System

Cicata Nexus is a web application developed for CICATA Unidad Morelos, a research center focused on creating scientific knowledge and technological development. The system was built to solve inefficiencies in the manual process for laboratory service requests, which often caused slow response times, unavailable materials, and conflicts in ongoing investigations.

The goal was to create an automated system that allows users to submit requests quickly and efficiently, removing the need for manual confirmations. It also helps the institution optimize inventory and material availability, reducing conflicts and improving planning.

This project was developed on **June 2025**.
